# sworkflow

Welcome to **sworkflow**! This organization provides a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of compiling and packaging Android Linux Kernel builds. Inspired by [kworkflow](https://kworkflow.org/), **sworkflow** enhances and simplifies kernel build automation for Android devices.

## Overview

**sworkflow** is a tool designed to automate, optimize, and simplify the Android Linux Kernel build process. Built with the aim of improving productivity, it integrates features such as custom configurations, multi-device support, build automation, and packaging.

The tool is based on the principles of **kworkflow**, but with additional improvements and features tailored for the Android Kernel build environment, making it easy to compile and package custom kernels for a wide range of Android devices.

## Key Features

- **Device-Specific Configurations**: Supports multiple device configurations for kernel building, allowing you to easily manage and switch between different device targets.
- **Automated Compilation Pipeline**: Automates the entire kernel build process, from source code fetch to kernel packaging, reducing manual steps and human error.
- **Modular Build Configuration**: Modular design allows users to configure different build steps, environments, and parameters based on the target device or Android version.
